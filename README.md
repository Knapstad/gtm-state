# The GTM version checker - for google cloud and slack

This script was made by inspiration from [Simo Hava's post on a slack notification system for Google Tag Manager changes](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/create-slack-notification-system-google-tag-manager-changes/)
It's intended use is as a [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) integrated with [Slack](https://www.slack.com), but you can run the script anywhere you like.

### Requirements
This script requires:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- a Google Tag Manager account
- a Google Cloud account
